The slides of the seminar held in April 2019 are now available. Speaker: C. Junya Motomura (Arc System Works Co., Ltd.)

Are you trying to solve all skinning problems with skinning? When skinning just doesn't work, the problem is often an inadequacy in the pre-skinning, modeling or rigging stages. With a little ingenuity at the modeling stage, the skinning work will be overwhelmingly easier, and better deformation results will be obtained. Conversely, if the mesh structure is flawed, skinning will often not solve the problem no matter how hard you try.

In this seminar, titled "Modeling for Skinning", we will introduce modeling tips for obtaining good skinning results. This course is intended for those who can create shapes with meshes but are not good at skinning, and those who want to deepen their understanding of skinning.

In this seminar, titled "Bone placement tips for action", we will introduce common mistakes in bone placement, how to avoid them, and practical guidelines for bone placement that can withstand action in fighting games. increase.
